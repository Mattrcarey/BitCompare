    I changed the way my code prints the first two lines because I realised
    after it prints string1: if its a file it prints the filename instead of
    the string in the file. I fixed the error with 0's  printing with 2 less
    zeros then the test by changing %#.16lx to %#018lx I also fixed a couple
    minor warnings and changed my perror("...") call to fprintf(stderr,"...")
    because I didnt want it to print success after printing the error and I
    didn't want to print any of the default errno values.

    when I did the try tests I found out one of my print statements wasnt
    exactly the same, It work correctly if the file is empty, the code was
    decoding the right letters but in the reverse order and when my code
    prints and hex with value 0 it prints 2 less 0's than it should.
    I fixed the print statement, the error with an empty file, I reversed my
    decode string and now I just need to fix the 0 printing I think

    I changed the file checking to check each parameter separetely, now I'm
    going moving on to documentation.

    I finished the file reading function to read everything and then call
    set_encode with the string. I also changed main to check for files and
    act correctly if both parameters files.
    Ok actually I just reread the hw sheet and I have to change my file checking to
    make it separate for each parameter.

    I finished the last three functions, the difference function,
    cardinality and decode and I believe they all work fine now I'm going to
    make it able to reads files as well.

    I made it so the unsigned long values will print the correct length, I
    also impletmented some of the other functions but have not tested them
    yet.

    I made a test c file because I wasn't sure what the encode function was
    asking us to do, I'll delete that.
    I figured out how to get the result that encode is looking for I just
    have to find out how to make it so it always prints with the same length.
    I made a function called encodechar where I copy pasted the reference
    letters/numbers and saved it as a string. I could have reversed the string
    and used the index as the shifting value but that would take a long time
    so I used modulo to get the shifting value from the oppasite index. This
    function returns the uint64 version of a char.
    I also finished set_encode, it just calls encodechar over and over and
    uses | to add them together.
