    I changed the file checking to check each parameter separetely, now I'm
    going moving on to documentation.

    I finished the file reading function to read everything and then call
    set_encode with the string. I also changed main to check for files and
    act correctly if both parameters files.
    Ok actually I just reread the hw sheet and I have to change my file checking to
    make it separate for each parameter.

    I finished the last three functions, the difference function,
    cardinality and decode and I believe they all work fine now I'm going to
    make it able to reads files as well.

    I made it so the unsigned long values will print the correct length, I
    also impletmented some of the other functions but have not tested them
    yet.

    I made a test c file because I wasn't sure what the encode function was
    asking us to do, I'll delete that.
    I figured out how to get the result that encode is looking for I just
    have to find out how to make it so it always prints with the same length.
    I made a function called encodechar where I copy pasted the reference
    letters/numbers and saved it as a string. I could have reversed the string
    and used the index as the shifting value but that would take a long time
    so I used modulo to get the shifting value from the oppasite index. This
    function returns the uint64 version of a char.
    I also finished set_encode, it just calls encodechar over and over and
    uses | to add them together.
